# D20CharacterCreator

This is a RPG character creator. Initially the focus will be on getting D&D 4th Edition to complete. Then from there expand out into other editions and the similar systems (i.e. pathfinder first before going too crazy (I'm looking at you Song of Ice and Fire system or Doctor Who).

To Download and try it out just grab the newest version (i.e. 0.4.4) and see how it's going.

If you have any feature requests, any issues you notice, etc post it as an issue (if it hasn't already been created). I'll then assign it to a project and work on it as priority sees fit.

Please star and comment if you're interested in this project.


(Shhhh don't tell but I'm also going to start work on a charactr manager / party manager / combat manger / session manager / compendium / etc. With a few other people. It'll be made with React Native and developed for both iOS and Android).
